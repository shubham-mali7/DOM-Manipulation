 Document ----> Javascript Object ----> Root Node

 child node of document -----> HTML ----> Root element

 >Dom Traversing -----> Agar hame root node pata hona, toh root node sai poore tree mai hum kahibhi jaa sakte hai (sab kuch connected hai).

 >The entire document is a document node
 >Every HTML element is an element node

event bubbling ---> aapne kisi ek event pai click kia agar uske parent pai bhi same event laga hua hai toh voh bhi call hojaega

google ki bhasha mai : Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.
